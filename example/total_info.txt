1.0******this update have somehow destroy the comment section . 1 why can i no longer reply to other reply ? it use to be that hit reply would add username to the start of a reply , which no longer happen . now i have to do that manually . it's not easy to follow a comment thread when you don't know who's reply to what . this username system be still apply on older version and the desktop version , so to remove it seem backwards . 2 on iphone 5s , when tap the comment button , the video move to full screen landscape , as well as the comment box , but the keyboard stay vertical , which cut off half the comment box and the actual send button . i have to tap the screen then tap keep write in order to force the keyboard into landscape . 3 the whole idea of do the comment in landscape be ridiculous anyway . i can't see what i'm reply to , and if i try to go back , i get hit with the pop up keep write or discard ? the entire comment section on mobile need to be reorganise . 4 when respond to a notification on a comment , i have to load the entire video again , then scroll down to the comment before i can reply . why not just load a full comment screen when i tap a notification so i can immediately read it and reply if necessary ? if i want to check the video again , there should be an option to do that . the major problem be that i shouldn't need to be drag out of my current video in order to read a reply . my current video should continue to play in the pip , so i can read and reply to the comment and not lose my place . you've already add comment to their own pane in the view all comment section , so why not just load a comment notification in this view ? seem like a pretty obvious change to me . 5 add a back button . if i tap a relate video , there be currently no way to simply go back to the previous video as there would be in a browser without go to the history section and play the last video . this be terrible for video discovery , as it give people second thought about check out another video in case they aren't interest and just want to go back . to be honest , i have no idea if developer be task with read these review , so i may be waste my time . but if you do , i think many people review this current version have many of the same complaint and you should take these obvious improvement on board .******update be screw .******Sep 24, 2016******11.35******AU
